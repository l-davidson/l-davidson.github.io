							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mountain-mtl.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								My name is Lydia Davidson and I am currently pursuing a degree in Engineering Physics at
								the University of British Columbia. I have always been drawn to technology and wanted to
								develop new things. With a desire to get a deeper understand of how the world around me works, I decided
								to pursue a degree in Engineering Physics because of its combination of electrical, mechanical, and computer engineering,
								in addition to providing a solid foundation in physics and mathematics. I believe this degree will
								provide the foundations that will allow me to achieve my dream of innovating new technology to help others.
								<br>
								<br>
								Apart from engineering, I enjoy getting active by going for walks with family or going for early
								morning runs. However, my favourite passtime is probably playing piano. Throughout my 13 years of taking piano lessons, I have
								learned how perseverance, hard work, and being detail-oriented can produce high-quality results. Playing
								piano has not only given me fun challenges to tackle when learning and seeking perfection in difficult
								pieces, but has also been a source of relaxation for me. I love to share my joy of music with others by
								volunteering at different events, like at a senior's residence in my home town. I have also enjoyed
								participating in several piano competitions across Quebec and have received the Level 10 Certificate with
								The Royal Convservatory of Music, which includes exams in practical piano, music history, and harmony.
								If you are interested, below is a video of me playing at the finals of the Concours de musique de la
								Capital in Quebec City in 2017, where I tied for first place for my age category.
