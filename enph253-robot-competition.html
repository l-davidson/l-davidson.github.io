							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>
								<!-- TODO - review -->
								In the ENPH 253 Introduction to Instrument Design course, taken by second-year Engineering Physics 
								students at UBC during the summer, my peers and I were challenged to build two autonomous robots to 
								play a unique version of the video game Overcooked. In the game, multiple chefs collaborate to serve 
								as many meals as possible within a limited time. In our edition, two robots had designated areas they 
								could navigate in and food they could reach, requiring them to collaborate to make different recipes 
								on the menu. After 6 weeks of working in the lab for nearly 12 hours every weekday, the teams of 3-4 
								students set their robots on the start line of the competition surface and watched their robot chefs 
								go head-to-head against another team. Each recipe was worth a different number of points based on 
								difficulty, and the team whose robots could score the most points in a two-minute round would win 
								the competition.
							</p>
							
							

							<h2>My Role</h2>
							<p>
								<!-- TODO - review -->
								My team consisted of four students and my primary role was to work on the mechanical design and 
								construction of the robots' claws. I used SolidWorks and Onshape to make 3D sketches and assemblies, 
								analyze the motion of moving parts, and make calculations. 
								<br>
								<br>
								As time allowed, I proceeded to design and build a tray that would sit on one of the robots and move 
								inwards and outwards. The moving tray allowed the robot to carry the plate with food while navigating 
								through the kitchen, thereby speeding up its ability to make an item on the menu. My role extended to 
								writing functions in software to implement the use of the tray. 
								<br>
								<br>
								In the final 1-2 weeks before the competition, I helped my team with the full integration of the robots, 
								which mostly included helping with wiring as well as attaching the claws and moving tray to the robot 
								chassis. I also helped test and troubleshoot the robots, which involved troubleshooting circuits and 
								editing the software.

							<h2>Competition Rules</h2>
							<p>
								<!-- TODO -->
								Below are some rules for the competition that had to be considered when designing the claw and tray.
								<ul>
									<li>Robots must not exceed 12”x18” in size (no height limit) when arms are retracted</li>
									<li>Robots cannot reach beyond the far edge of each counter (i.e., a robot cannot reach over 
										the centre counter)
									</li>
									<li>Countertops are 6" high (robots must be able to accommodate to slight inaccuracies)</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<h2>Items to Pick Up</h2>
							<!-- TODO - create a table with size & weight instead of bulleted list-->
							<ul>
								<li>Paper plate (~170mm diameter)</li>
								<li>Top & bottom bun (90mm diameter)</li>
								<li>Patty (80mm diameter)</li>
								<li>Cheese (~76mm square)</li>
								<li>Tomato (~76mm diameter)</li>
								<li>Lettuce (~60mm x 76mm)</li>
							</ul>

							<!-- TODO - put image beside text instead of below -->

							<!-- <h2>Team Goals for the Project</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Make as many deluxe burgers as possible</li>
									<li>Make cheese plates and/or salads if there is not enough time to make another deluxe burger 
										before time runs out</li>
									<li></li>
								</ul>
							</p> -->

							<h2>Claw Design</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>After brainstorming ideas as a team, we decided to use a four-bar linkage driven by a servo motor to 
										clamp the food and plate. Advantages of the four-bar linkage claw design included:</li>
									<ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
										<li>Ability to open wide, reducing the amount of accuracy required to line up the robot perfectly 
											in front of the food on the counters</li>
										<li>Ability to pick up items of various sizes (i.e., plate and food of various sizes)</li>
										<li>Links stay perfectly parallel while closing, so the two points of contact should always be on 
											either side of the clamped food, so the food should never be pushed inwards or outwards when 
											the claw closes</li>
									</ul>
									<li>The four-bar linkage was partly made of aluminum sheet metal for lightness and bent into a U shape 
										to add strength and reduce bending</li>
									<li>The four-bar linkage also had two parts made of acrylic, allowing it to be laser cut into a rounded 
										shape to wrap around the rods that were on either side of the lead screw for support. Laser cutting 
										acrylic also allowed the links and gears to be one piece.</li>
									<li>3D-printed pieces were attached to the end of the four-bar linkage with softer material glued to it 
										for gripping the items</li>
									<li>To allow for upward and downward movement in order to pick up food at counter height and stack them
										on another part of the counter, as well as to account for slight variances in counter height, the 
										four-bar linkage was attached to a nut that fit on a lead screw driven by a DC motor</li>
									<li>A microswitch was placed on the bottom of the four-bar linkage to signal the DC motor to stop when 
										the claw had lowered down to counter height</li>
									<li>A piece of MDF was laser cut to act as the base plate for the four-bar linkage.</li>
									<li>Rod busings (for the rods that acted as support on either side of the lead screw) and pieces to hold 
										the nut for the lead screw were 3D-printed and attached to the piece of MDF.</li>
									<li>A 3D-printed piece (which also held the servo motor) was secured on top of the gears that drove the 
										four-bar linkage to counter the upward force created by the weight of the four-bar linkage 
										and the items it picked up.
									</li>
									<li>The rod bushings were made as long (down the rod) and wide (at the base where it connects to the MDF) 
										as possible to also counter the force created by the weight of the four-bar linkage and the items it 
										picked up.
									</li>
								</ul>

							<h2>Tools Used</h2>
							<p>As I prototyped the claw, I learned and gained experience using various tools and machines including:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Sheet metal tools: bending brake, hand seamer, plate shear, hole punch</li>
								<li>Hand drill</li>
								<li>Hacksaw and coping saw</li>
								<li>3D printer</li>
								<li>Laser cutter</li>
							</ul>
							

							<h2>Tests Performed on the Claw</h2>
							<p>I tested the claw in isolation from the rest of the robot to ensure it was capable of what I intended 
								and to make improvements before integrating it with the rest of the robot.
							</p>

							<h3>Some tests I did include:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Testing the claw's ability to pick up all the food items and the plate</li>
								<li>Monitored the current draw of the servo and DC motors when clamping items using a power supply</li>
								<li>Wrote code to test how much each item needed to be over-clamped to balance having enough grip without 
									drawing too much current</li>
								<li>Tested that the DC motor controlled the lead screw would stop moving the claw downwards once the microswitch hit the counter.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Some improvements I made include:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Added a sponge to the 3D-printed pieces on the four-bar linkage, which could mold around the items  
									being clamped. This improved the claw's ability to grip the plate with food on it (without bending 
									the plate), the top bun (which was heavier than other food items and shaped like a dome), and the 
									cheese</li>
								<li>Loosened the locknuts on the joints and adjusted the size of the spacers inside the U shape of the 
									sheet metal to decrease the friction in the joints and thereby decreasing the torque (and current 
									draw) required by the servo motor</li>
								<li>Modified the shape of the rod bushings that attached to the MDF (where the base of the four-bar 
									linkage attached) so that the four-bar linkage could retract further to fit within the 12" size limit</li>
								<li>Adjusted the side of the rod bushings to find better balance between being loose enough to slide smoothly but tight enough 
									to have minimal play (to keep the four-bar linkage as horizontal as possible)
								</li>
							</ul>

							</div>  

							<h2>Tray Design</h2>
							<p>A sliding tray that could extend and retract was designed for one of the robots to carry the plate and food 
								as it navigated through the kitchen.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>A rack and pinion, driven by a continuous servo motor, allowed the tray to slide outward and inward 
									on a set of drawer slides
								</li>
								<li>The tray had to slide outward and inward in order to meet the size restrictions of the robot and to 
									allow the robot to go up to the counter and reach to pick up food</li>
								<li>The tray was 3D-printed, allowing the tray and L-shaped slide mounting brackets to be printed 
									as one piece. It was necessary to not have any bolt heads or nuts above the top surface of the tray, 
									as it might interfere with the claw (when picking up the plate from the tray). While a countersink would 
									have been another option, it was not possible due to the long queue for other manufacturing methods and 
									the short timeline of the project.</li>
								<li>Ribs were printed on the bottom surface of the tray to increase strength and reduce bending</li>
								<li>An anti-slip pad was glued to the top of the tray to keep the plate from sliding around while 
									the robot navigated through the kitchen
								</li>
								<li>The rack and pinion were also 3D-printed due to delays with other manufacturing methods. 
									3D-printing allowed the rack and L-shaped slide mounting brackets to be printed as one piece (similar to 
									the tray). A rib was also added to the bottom of the rack to reduce bending.
								</li>
								<li>A microswitch was plated on the top of the robot chassis to re-home the continuous servo when it 
									was drawn inward. The distance that the tray extended was determined by the time (in microseconds) 
									that the motor was turned on for.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Tests Performed for the Tray</h2>
							<p>I tested the setup for the tray on the top piece of the chassis before everything else was attached, allowing 
								me to make quick and easy adjustments. Below is a list of things I did during testing.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Wrote code to calibrate and test the continuous servo on its own</li>
								<li>Tested the continuous servo's ability to drive the rack back and forth when attached to the drawer 
									slides and tray</li>
								<li>Adjusted the size of the rack and pinion for better meshing of the teeth</li>
								<li>Tested how well the paper plate would stay on the tray while it was moving back and forth</li>
								<li>Adjusted the time delay in the code that the continuous servo was turned on so that the desired 
									extension was obtained
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>
								Below is a video I took after writing basic code for the continuous servo to test the setup.
							</p>

							<figcaption>Video 4: Testing the sliding tray driven by the continuous servo motor.</figcaption>

							<br>

							<p>After testing that the tray design worked, I wrote software functions that implemented the use of the tray 
								when making different recipes (e.g., a salad or burger).

							<!-- <h2>Overview of Non-Mechanical Work</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Helped with wiring</li>
								<li>Reviewed the software code and made modifications while troubleshooting (our team used the Arduino 
									framework with PlatformIO in VS Code)
								</li>
							</ul> -->

							<h2>Results</h2>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>The joints had very little play in them, allowing for precise and accurate movements of the four-bar linkage</li>
									<li>The rod bushings were sized such that they could slide smoothly along the rods while keeping the four-bar linkage 
										nearly perfectly parallel with the ground
									</li>
									<li>The claw was able to successfully pick up every food item and the plate without falling out of 
										its grip, even when I shook it up & down and side to side</li>
									<li>Isolated from the rest of the robot, the claw could lower to counter height, close to pick up an 
										item, and raise a few centimeters in preparation to stack the food on the plate or into a burger</li>
									<li>The tray could successfully move inwards and outwards in a sequence with the movement of the four-bar linkage 
										that would allow one of the robots to make a simple burger (plate, bottom bun, patty, top bun) directly on the 
										tray while moving from counter to counter 
									</li>
								</ul>
